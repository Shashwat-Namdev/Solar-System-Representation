# Solar-System-Representation
Solar System College Project, It is a representation of our Solar system, made with python.
The Project may not work without creating Virtual Environment, to create Virtual Environment - 
First open the 'Realistic Solar System' folder with Visual Studio Code, run the 'Solar System.py' file on it, popup should show to create Virtual Environment.
After creating it, you may need to install vpython on VS Code, simply type 'pip install vpython' on the terminal (when you run terminal will open)
Same goes for other libraries like 'tkinter' and 'math' (if giving error on math or tkinter).
A new window will open on a browser to show the output.
